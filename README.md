# Quantum Delivery Scheduling Optimization 🚚⚛️  

> **Optimize deliveries with Quantum-inspired Scheduling!**  
> A research-driven project transforming delivery scheduling into a **QUBO problem** and solving it using **state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms**.  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  

**Quantum Delivery Scheduling Optimization** models the **delivery scheduling problem** as a **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** problem.  
The objective: **minimize total delivery time (makespan)** across multiple couriers — while respecting **capacity limits, package assignments, and delivery time windows**.  

✨ The project provides a **comparative analysis** of several solvers, evaluating both **efficiency** and **solution quality**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- 🧩 **Classical QUBO formulation** for delivery scheduling.  
- 🔧 **Multiple solver support**: Simulated Annealing, D-Wave Classical Solver, MILP (OR-Tools).  
- 📦 **Modular code** for experimentation & future extensions.  
- 📊 **Comprehensive metrics & visualizations** (Gantt charts, QUBO heatmaps, solver comparisons).  

---

## 🧠 Methodology  

### 🔹 QUBO Formulation  
The problem is encoded into binary variables representing **courier–package–time slot** assignments.  

Constraints enforced:  
- ✅ Each package is assigned **exactly once**.  
- 📦 Couriers adhere to **capacity limits**.  
- ⏱️ Deliveries meet **time windows**.

## 🛠️ Solvers  

| Solver | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔥 **Simulated Annealing (neal)** | Approximate QUBO solutions using a classical annealing algorithm. |
| ⚛️ **D-Wave Classical Sampler** | Uses D-Wave’s `SimulatedAnnealingSampler` (classical, not quantum hardware). |
| 📐 **MILP (OR-Tools)** | Mixed-Integer Linear Programming as a strong baseline. |
